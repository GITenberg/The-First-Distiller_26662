<h2>ACT I</h2>


<p><span class="speaker">PEASANT</span> [<i>ploughing. Looks up</i>] It's noon. Time to unharness.
Gee up, get along! Fagged out? Poor old
beast! One more turn and back again, that will be the
last furrow, and then dinner. It was a good idea to bring
that chunk of bread with me. I'll not go home, but sit
down by the well and have a bite and a rest, and Peggy
can graze awhile. Then, with God's help, to work again,
and the ploughing will be done in good time.</p>

<p><i>Enter Imp; hides behind a bush.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">IMP.</span> See what a good fellow he is! Keeps calling on
God. Wait a bit, friend,&mdash;you'll be calling on the Devil
before long! I'll just take away his chunk. He'll miss
it before long, and will begin to hunt for it. He'll be
hungry, and then he'll swear and call on the Devil.</p>

<p><i>Takes the chunk of bread and sits down behind the bush
watching to see what the Peasant will do.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">PEASANT</span> [<i>unharnesses the horse</i>] With God's blessing!
[<i>Lets the horse loose, and goes towards the place where his
coat is lying</i>] I'm awfully hungry. The wife cut a big
chunk, but see if I don't eat it all. [<i>Coming up to the coat</i>]
Gone! I must have put it under the coat. [<i>Lifting the
coat</i>] No, it's not here either! What has happened?
[<i>Shakes the coat</i>].</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100">100</a></span>
<span class="speaker">IMP</span> [<i>behind the bush</i>] Go on, go on, search away! I've
got it safe!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PEASANT</span> [<i>moves the plough and shakes his coat again</i>] This
is strange! Very strange! No one was here, yet the chunk
is gone! If the birds had been at it there would be
some crumbs left, but there's not a single crumb! No
one has been here, and yet some one has taken it!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">IMP</span> [<i>rises and looks out</i>] Now he'll call on the Devil.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PEASANT.</span> Well, it seems there's no help for it! Never
mind, I shan't starve to death. If some one has taken it,
he's taken it; let him eat it, and may it do him good.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">IMP</span> [<i>spits</i>] Oh, the damned peasant! Instead of swearing
properly, he only says, &ldquo;May it do him good.&rdquo; What
can one do with such a fellow?</p>

<p><i>Peasant lies down to rest, makes the sign of the cross, yawns,
and falls asleep.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">IMP</span> [<i>comes out from behind the bush</i>] It's all very well
for the boss to talk. The boss keeps on saying, &ldquo;You
don't bring enough peasants to Hell! See what a lot of
tradesmen, gentlefolk, and all sorts of people flock in
every day, and how few peasants!&rdquo; Now, how's one
to get round this one? There's no way of getting hold
of him. Haven't I stolen his last crust? What can I do
better than that? And yet he didn't swear. I'm at my
wits' end what to do! Well, I must go and report!</p>

<p><i>Disappears into the ground.</i></p>

<h2>ACT II</h2>

<p class="scene">Hell. The Chief of the Devils sits in the highest place. The
Devil's Secretary sits lower down, at a table with writing
materials. Sentinels stand at each side. To the right are
five Imps of different kinds. To the left, by the door, the
Doorkeeper. A dandified Imp stands before the Chief.</p>


<p><span class="speaker">THE DANDY IMP.</span> The whole of my booty for the three
years has been 220,005 men. They're all in my power
now.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">THE CHIEF.</span> All right. Thank you. Pass on.</p>

<p><i>The Dandy Imp goes to the right.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">THE CHIEF</span> [<i>to the Secretary</i>] I'm tired! Is there much
business left? Whose reports have we had, and whose
are still to come?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">THE SECRETARY</span> [<i>counts on his fingers and, as he counts,
points to the Imps to the right. When he mentions any Imp,
the one referred to bows</i>] We've had the Gentlefolks' Devil's
report. He's captured 1836 in all. And the Tradesmen's
Devil's with 9643. From the Lawyers', 3423. The Women's
we've also just had: 186,315 married women, and 17,438
maids. Only two Devils are left, the Officials' and the
Peasants'. There are altogether 220,005 souls on the
list.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">CHIEF.</span> Well then, we'd better finish it all to-day. [<i>To
the Doorkeeper</i>] Let them in!</p>

<p><i>The Officials' Devil enters, and bows to the Chief.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">CHIEF.</span> Well, how have you got on?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">OFFICIALS' IMP</span> [<i>laughing, and rubbing his hands</i>] My affairs
are all right, just as soot they are white! The booty is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102">102</a></span>such that I don't remember anything like it since the
creation of the world.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">CHIEF.</span> What, have you captured a great many?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">OFFICIALS' IMP.</span> It's not so much the quantity. Only
1350 men in all, but such splendid fellows! Such fellows,
they might shame any Devil! They can embroil people
better than we ourselves can. I've introduced a new
fashion among them.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">CHIEF.</span> What's that new fashion?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">OFFICIALS' IMP.</span> Why, in former times lawyers were in
attendance on the judges and deceived people. Now, I've
arranged for them to do business also apart from the judges.
Whoever pays most, is the one to whose business they
attend. And they'll take such trouble over it that they'll
make out a case where there is none! They and the
officials between them embroil people far better than we
Devils can.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">CHIEF.</span> All right. I'll have a look at them. You may
pass on.</p>

<p><i>The Officials' Imp goes to the right.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">CHIEF</span> [<i>to Doorkeeper</i>] Let in the last one.</p>

<p><i>Enter the Peasants' Imp with the chunk of bread. He bows
to the ground.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">PEASANTS' IMP.</span> I can't live like this any longer! Give
me another appointment!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">CHIEF.</span> What appointment? What are you jabbering
about? Get up and talk sense. Give in your report!
How many peasants have you captured this week?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PEASANTS' IMP</span> [<i>crying</i>] Not one!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">CHIEF.</span> What? Not one! What do you mean? What
have you been doing? Where have you been loafing?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PEASANTS' IMP</span> [<i>whimpering</i>] I've not been loafing; I've
been straining every nerve all the time, but I can't do
anything! There now, I went and took his last crust
from under the very nose of one of them, and, instead of
swearing, he wished it might do me good!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103">103</a></span>
<span class="speaker">CHIEF.</span> What?&hellip; What?&hellip; What are you mumbling
there? Just blow your nose, and then speak sensibly!
One can't make head or tail of what you're saying.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PEASANTS' IMP.</span> Why, there was a peasant ploughing;
and I knew he had brought only a chunk of bread with
him, and had nothing else to eat. I stole his crust. By
rights he should have sworn; but what does he do? He
says, &ldquo;Let him who has taken it eat it, and may it do him
good!&rdquo; I've brought the chunk of bread away with me.
Here it is!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">CHIEF.</span> Well, and what of the others?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PEASANTS' IMP.</span> They're all alike. I could not manage
to take a single one.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">CHIEF.</span> How dare you appear before me with empty
hands? And as if that were not enough, you must needs
bring some stinking crust or other here! Do you mean to
mock me? Do you mean to live in Hell and eat the bread
of idleness? The others do their best, and work hard!
Why, they [<i>points to the Imps</i>] have each supplied 10,000
or 20,000, or even 200,000. And you come with empty
hands, and bring a miserable crust, and begin spinning
your yarns. You chatter, but don't work; and that's why
you've lost hold of them. But wait a bit, my friend, I'll
teach you a thing or two!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PEASANTS' IMP.</span> Before you punish me, listen to what I'll
tell you. It's all very well for those other Devils, who
have to do with gentlefolk, with merchants, or with
women. It's all plain sailing for them! Show a nobleman
a coronet, or a fine estate, and you've got him, and may
lead him where you like. It's the same with a tradesman.
Show him some money and stir up his covetousness, and
you may lead him as with a halter. And with the women
it's also plain sailing. Give them finery and sweets&mdash;and
you may do what you like with them. But as to the
peasants&mdash;there's a long row to hoe with them! When
he's at work from morn till night&mdash;sometimes even far
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104">104</a></span>into the night&mdash;and never starts without a thought of God,
how's one to get at him? Master, remove me from these
peasants! I'm tired to death of them, and have angered
you into the bargain!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">CHIEF.</span> You're humbugging, you idler! It's no use
your talking about the others. They've got hold of the
merchants, the nobles, and the women, because they knew
how to treat them, and invented new traps for them! The
official one there&mdash;he has made quite a new departure.
You must think of something too! You've stolen a crust,
and brag about it! What a clever thing to do! Surround
them with snares, and they'll get caught in one or other
of them. But loafing about as you do, and leaving the
way open for them, those peasants of yours have gained
strength. They begin not to care about their last crust.
If they take to such ways, and teach their women the
same, they'll get quite beyond us! Invent something!
Get out of the hole as best you can.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PEASANTS' IMP.</span> I can't think how to set about it. Let
me off! I can stand it no longer!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">CHIEF</span> [<i>angrily</i>] Can't stand it! What do you think,
then? Am I to do your work for you?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PEASANTS' IMP.</span> I can't!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">CHIEF.</span> Can't? Wait a bit! Hollo, there! bring the
switches; give him a thrashing.</p>

<p><i>The Sentinels seize the Imp and whip him.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">PEASANTS' IMP.</span> Oh! Oh! Oh!&hellip;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">CHIEF.</span> Have you thought of something?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PEASANTS' IMP.</span> Oh, oh, I can't!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">CHIEF.</span> Give him some more. [<i>They whip</i>] Well&mdash;thought
of something?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PEASANTS' IMP.</span> Yes&mdash;yes, I have!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">CHIEF.</span> Well, tell us what it is.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PEASANTS' IMP.</span> I've invented a dodge that will bring
them all into my grasp, if you'll only let me take a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105">105</a></span>labourer's place with that peasant. But I can't explain
what it is beforehand.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">CHIEF.</span> All right. Only remember, that if you don't
atone for that crust within three years, I'll flay you alive!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PEASANTS' IMP.</span> They'll all be mine in three years' time.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">CHIEF.</span> All right. When the three years are past, I
shall come and see for myself!</p>

<h2>ACT III</h2>

<p class="scene">A barn. Carts loaded with grain. The Imp as a Labourer.
He is shovelling grain off the cart, and the Peasant is carrying
it away in a measure.</p>


<p><span class="speaker">LABOURER.</span> Seven!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PEASANT.</span> How many quarters?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">LABOURER</span> [<i>looks at the numbers marked on the barn door</i>]
Twenty-six quarters. And this is the seventh bushel of
the twenty-seventh quarter.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PEASANT.</span> It won't all go in; the barn is nearly full!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">LABOURER.</span> Shovel it nice and even.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PEASANT.</span> So I will.</p>

<p><i>Exit with measure.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">LABOURER</span> [<i>alone, takes off his cap, his horns appear</i>] It will
be some time before he returns. I'll ease my horns a bit.
[<i>Horns rise</i>] And I'll take my boots off too; I can't do it
when he's here. [<i>Takes his boots off, his hoofs appear. Sits
on the threshold</i>] It's the third year now. It's near the
time of reckoning. There's more corn than there's room
for. Only one more thing left to teach him, and then let
the Chief come and see for himself. I'll have something
worth showing him! He'll forgive me for that crust!</p>

<p><i>Neighbour approaches. Labourer hides his horns and hoofs.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">NEIGHBOUR.</span> Good day to you.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">LABOURER.</span> The same to you.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NEIGHBOUR.</span> Where's your master?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">LABOURER.</span> He's gone to spread the grain more even; it
won't all go in.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NEIGHBOUR.</span> Dear me, what a run of luck your master is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107">107</a></span>having! More than he has room for? We're all amazed
at the harvests your master has had these two years. It's
as if some one had told him what was coming. Last year
was a dry season, and he had sown in the bog. Others had
no harvest, but your threshing ground was covered with
sheaves! This year we've a rainy summer, and he's been
sharp enough to sow on the hill. Everybody's corn has
rotted, but you have a splendid harvest. What grain!
Ah, what grain!</p>

<p><i>Takes some grain, weighs it in his hand, and chews it.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">PEASANT</span> [<i>enters with empty measure</i>] How d'ye do, neighbour?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NEIGHBOUR.</span> Good day. I was saying to your man here,
how well you managed to guess where to sow your corn.
Every one envies you. What heaps, what heaps of corn
you have got! You'll not eat it all in ten years.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PEASANT.</span> It's all thanks to Nicholas here. [<i>Points to
Labourer</i>] It was his luck. Last year I sent him to plough,
and what did he do but plough in the bog. I gave him a
scolding, but he persuaded me to sow there. And so I
did, and it turned out all for the best! And this year he
again guessed right, and sowed on the hill!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NEIGHBOUR.</span> It's as if he knew what kind of season it
would be. Yes, you have got corn enough and no mistake!
[<i>Silence</i>] And I have come to ask you to lend me a sack
of rye. Ours is all used up. I'll return it next year.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PEASANT.</span> All right, you may have it.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">LABOURER</span> [<i>nudging the Peasant</i>] Don't give it!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PEASANT.</span> No more words about it. Take it.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NEIGHBOUR.</span> Thank you. I'll just run and fetch a sack.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">LABOURER</span> [<i>aside</i>] He keeps to his old ways &hellip; still
goes on giving. He doesn't always obey me. But just
wait a bit. He'll soon stop giving away.</p>

<p><i>Exit Neighbour.</i></p>

<p>That's what the old folk say.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PEASANT.</span> Don't worry. We've plenty of corn.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">LABOURER.</span> Well, what of that?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PEASANT.</span> We've enough, not only till next harvest but
for two years ahead. What are we to do with it all?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">LABOURER.</span> What are we to do with it? I could make
such stuff of this corn as would make you rejoice all the
days of your life.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PEASANT.</span> Why, what would you make of it?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">LABOURER.</span> A kind of drink. Drink, that would give
you strength when you are weak, satisfy you when you
are hungry, give you sleep when you are restless, make
you merry when you're sad, give you courage when you're
afraid. That's the drink I'd make!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PEASANT.</span> Rubbish!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">LABOURER.</span> Rubbish indeed! It was just the same when
I told you to sow in the bog, and then on the hill. You
did not believe me then, but now you know! You'll
find out about the drink the same way.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PEASANT.</span> But what will you make it of?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">LABOURER.</span> Why, of this same corn.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PEASANT.</span> But won't that be a sin?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">LABOURER.</span> Just hear him! Why should it be a sin?
Everything is given for a joy to man.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PEASANT.</span> And where did you get all your wisdom from,
Nick? You seem a very ordinary man to look at, and
hard-working too. Why, I don't remember you so much
as ever taking your boots off all these two years you've been
with me. And yet you seem to know everything. Where
did you learn it?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">LABOURER.</span> I've been about a good deal!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109">109</a></span>
<span class="speaker">PEASANT.</span> And so you say this drink will give one
strength?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">LABOURER.</span> Just wait till you try it and see the good
that comes of it.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PEASANT.</span> And how are we to make it?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">LABOURER.</span> It's not hard to make when you know how!
Only we shall want a copper and a couple of iron vessels.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PEASANT.</span> And does it taste nice?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">LABOURER.</span> As sweet as honey. When once you've tasted
it you'll never give it up.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PEASANT.</span> Is that so? Well, I'll go to the neighbour's;
he used to have a copper. We'll have a try!</p>

Eh? It's good, ain't it?</p>

showing.</p>


<p><span class="speaker">LABOURER.</span> There's lots of corn. More than there's
room for, and he's now got a taste for it. We've been
distilling again, and we've filled a barrel and hidden it
away. We're not going to treat any one for nothing, but
when we want to get something out of a fellow, then we'll
treat him! So to-day I told him to invite the village
elders and treat them, that they should divide up the
property between him and his grandfather, and give
everything to him and nothing to the old man! My three
years are up to-day, and my work is finished. Let the
Chief come and see for himself. I needn't be ashamed of

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115">115</a></span>
<span class="speaker">LABOURER.</span> Yes, we've distilled as much as we need.
Why let valuable stuff be wasted?</p>

you'll see what will happen. Even now they are
giving each other smooth oily words; presently they'll
start flattering each other,&mdash;as cunning as foxes.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PEASANT.</span> Well, old friends, what's your opinion of my
business? My grandfather has been living with me, and
I have been feeding him and feeding him, and now he's
gone to live with my uncle, and wants to take his share
of the property and give it to uncle! Consider it well;
you are wise men. We could as well do without our own
heads as without you. There's no one in the whole village
to come near you. Take you for example, Iv&aacute;n Fed&oacute;titch&mdash;doesn't
every one say you're first among men? And
as for me, I'll tell you the truth, Iv&aacute;n Fed&oacute;titch, I'm

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who

things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this

     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
